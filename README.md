# Arabic Spell Correction

## Project Overview
The **Arabic Spell Checker** is a tool developed to detect and correct misspelled words in Arabic text. Leveraging the Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm, this spell checker efficiently identifies and suggests corrections for errors in letters, diacritical marks, or word structure. This project aims to enhance the accuracy of Arabic text processing applications, such as text editors, educational tools, and natural language processing systems.

## Problem Definition
The problem of Arabic spell correction involves detecting and correcting misspelled words in Arabic text. This includes identifying spelling errors due to incorrect letters, diacritical marks, or word structure.


## Design

### Workflow

1. **Input:** Arabic text containing misspelled words.
2. **Processing:**
   - **Data Loading:** Load a preprocessed dataset of Arabic text.
   - **Dictionary Creation:** Generate a dictionary of words and their frequencies from the dataset.
   - **Tokenization:** Split the input sentence into individual words.
   - **Error Detection & Correction:** For each misspelled word, find the closest words in the dictionary based on the Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
   - **Suggestion Sorting:** Sort the closest words based on their distance and frequency.
3. **Output:** Provide a list of correction suggestions for each misspelled word in the input sentence.


## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python and utilizes several libraries for text processing and distance calculations.

### Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the input text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase.
- **Dictionary Creation:** Builds a frequency dictionary from the preprocessed dataset.
- **Spell Checking:** Uses the Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm to find and suggest corrections for misspelled words.

### Results
The project successfully developed a spell-checker for Arabic text using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance algorithm. The spell-checker was able to identify misspelled words and suggest corrections based on the closest words in a preprocessed text dataset. Sample outputs demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in providing relevant suggestions for various misspelled inputs.
